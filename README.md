# Visual-Analytics-Project

Football professionals increasingly need to search for players’ statistics and to compare them in order to choose
the player that suits them best. Moreover football fans want to look at their favorite players’ statistics. The aim of
this work is to give them an interactive dashboard made of different visualizations containing statistics and data
that can help them to achieve their goals. More precisely, this work uses only data coming from the football season
2021/22 and from the top 5 European leagues.
